# exampleEBARS

<!-- badges: start -->

The exampleEBARS consists of all R codes for numerical experiments in the article ***Extended Bayesian information criterion for multivariate spline knot inference***. The source package can be found in [EBARS](https://github.com/junhuihe2000/EBARS). We implement the applications of the proposed method in knot inference, manifold denoising and function fitting.

## Overview

1. `knot_inference` includes simulations and figures of knot inference in linear spline models with one, two and four knots.
2. `manifold` includes datasets, simulations, output and figures of manifold denoising in three scenarios of arcs, spiral curve and Swiss roll. 
3. `fitting` includes the prediction performance in curve and surface fitting with jumping discontinuity.
